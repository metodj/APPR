Vidimo, da je z izjemo prvih let po krizi (2008, 2009) indeks v povprečju vseskozi rastel. Ker bo za nadaljno analizo pomembno v kakšnem razmerju so vzponi in padci (oz. enke in ničle v stoplcu \"Gibanje\"), preštejem še to. Ugotovim, da so podatki lepo porazdeljeni po obeh razredih, tj. v 54% opazovanih dni je indeks rastel (kar na prvi pogled sicer ni očitno iz grafa)."
